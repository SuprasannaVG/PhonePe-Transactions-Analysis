# Description
This project aims to streamline financial analysis by automatically extracting and analyzing transaction data from PhonePe PDF statements. Leveraging Python for data extraction and manipulation, along with HTML and CSS for frontend development, it offers users a seamless way to upload their transaction PDFs and gain actionable insights. The system generates interactive charts and graphs that visualize spending patterns, transaction frequencies, and financial metrics. By providing clear visualizations, the project empowers users to make informed financial decisions and track their expenses efficiently.


# Implementation 

**PDF Data Extraction:** Utilizes Python libraries like PyPDF2 or pdfplumber to extract transaction details such as date, amount, and description from PhonePe PDF statements.
**Data Cleaning and Processing:** Implements data cleaning techniques to handle inconsistencies and ensure accurate analysis. This involves parsing and structuring the extracted data for further processing.
**Visualization with Charts:** Integrates data visualization libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly to generate interactive charts and graphs. These visualizations depict spending trends, transaction categories, and other financial insights.
**User Interface Development:** Utilizes HTML and CSS for frontend development to create a user-friendly interface. Implements file upload functionalities and displays visualizations in a responsive manner for optimal user experience.
**Data Analysis Features:** Implements algorithms and calculations to derive financial metrics such as total spending, average transaction amount, and categorical spending breakdowns. This provides users with comprehensive insights into their financial habits.
**Integration and Deployment:** Ensures seamless integration of backend data processing with frontend UI components. May deploy the application on platforms like GitHub Pages or Heroku for accessibility and testing by users.
